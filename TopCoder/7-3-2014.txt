Dear diary,


Today I experienced something new in this world. I am not gonna name it clearly, but just enough to remember later. After having it, I felt like weightless and 
floating around in the spacewith my hands fully extended outwards. It felt awesome but the timing was not correct. It would have been perfecct if I was havinnng
 JL in my arms, just me and her, for hours. That moment will come, for sure( :-) ). We(SP, SG, BK), all tried it but effect, only I felt. May be due to less exposure
 or not good health.
